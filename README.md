# Neotrellis-Examples-RP-Pico
Edited the Adafruit examples to work with Raspberry Pi Pico in Arduino IDE

I recently built a Neotrellis Grid and wanted to test the seesaw boards before committing to soldering. These are the two little test programs for the Neotrellis boards provided by Adafruit but modified so it knows how to use the i2c bus. I used Arduino IDE, you will need the RP2040 board manager and the adafruit seesaw libraries downloaded for this to work.

Huge thanks to Denki Oto for making this happen.
